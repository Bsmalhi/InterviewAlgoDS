Karat interview 5 System design questions

1) Advantages and Disadvantages of Running System on Multiple Servers vs single server(Music App)
   Advantages:
   Scalability: Can handle more users/requests by distributing load.
   Fault Tolerance: One server fails → others continue serving.
   Geographic Distribution: Reduced latency by serving users closer to edge nodes.
   Separation of Concerns: Isolate services (e.g., auth, media delivery, metadata).

   Disadvantages:
   Consistency Management: Keeping data (e.g., playlists, user prefs) synced.
   Increased Complexity: Requires load balancers, service discovery, monitoring.
   Cost Overhead: More infra = more cost.
   Deployment Coordination: Rollouts across multiple nodes may cause partial failures.

2) Estimate Data Storage Cost for Logging for 1 Year
    avg log size × events/sec × 60 × 60 × 24 × 365
    Should have talked about the below factors to consider as well
    Retention policy (e.g., hot vs cold storage).
    Compression ratio (often 4–5x with gzip).
    Storage tier (e.g., AWS S3 vs EBS vs Glacier).
    Redundancy (multi-AZ or cross-region).

3) Arcade Game Sensor Expansion to 125,000 Machines
   Scalability: Central server may get flooded. Need edge processing or rate-limiting.
   Connectivity: Machines need reliable, possibly offline-tolerant sync (store-and-forward).
   Security: Cards should be encrypted; tamper protection for devices.
   Firmware Updates: How to push fixes to 125K sensors?
   Data Consistency: Ensure payment updates are atomic.
   Latency: Fast enough response to avoid poor user experience.
   Monitoring: Track failures, fraud attempts, or sensor errors across all locations.

4) Password Validation: What is the issue with below password design
English only words are rejected
Current requirement -
    a) minimum 8 - 16 characters
    b) contains one Uppercase, one lowercase, one symbol
Answer as discussed - suggested to remove 8 - 16 char requirement which will allow to add variety

5) File Deduplication via Size Check → Byte Check → Symlink is this design proper?
